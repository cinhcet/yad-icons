# yad-icons

Icons as native web-components.

When installing this software via `npm install` (or by running `node convert.js`), all icons from https://github.com/Templarian/MaterialDesign-JS as part of the Material Design Icons project (http://materialdesignicons.com/) are converted to native web-components.

The converted icons can be found in the folder `components` with the naming scheme
```
yad-icons-mdi-NAME.js
```
where `NAME` corresponds to the name of the icon found in http://materialdesignicons.com/

Do not redistribute the converted icons without taking the licences of the original icons, see https://github.com/Templarian/MaterialDesign, into account.
